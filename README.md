# dijkstra-route-files

---

This repository contains a project developed for the Computer Science course, which addresses the study of Graph Theory and implements a route calculation system using the Java language and the Swing library for the graphical interface.

## Description

> The objective of this work is to calculate efficient routes based on configuration files in TXT format. The system reads the configuration files, which contain information about the registered routes, such as the points of origin, destination, distance and other relevant characteristics. Using the principles of Graph Theory, the project allows finding the most efficient route between two points selected by the user.
>
> The project uses a representation of graphs to store and analyze the registered routes. The origin and destination points are represented as graph nodes, and the distances between them are represented by edges. Based on this information, search and optimization algorithms are applied, such as the Dijkstra algorithm to find the route with the shortest distance or shortest travel time.
>
> The project's graphical interface was developed using the Swing library, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience. Through the interface, it is possible to select the points of origin and destination, view the calculated route, as well as other relevant information about the registered routes.

## Main Features and Functionalities
